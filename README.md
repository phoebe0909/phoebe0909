- 👋 Hi, I’m Phoebe Weiss.
- 👀 I’m interested in using technology to create greater access to essential services.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and Kotlin. My current focus is building Android apps and I plan to attend a coding bootcamp in January 2023.
- 💞️ I'd love to collaborate with UI/UX designers who would like to add some functionality to their portfolios.
- 📫 How to reach me ... github is a good start:)
